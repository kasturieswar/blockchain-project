# 🔐 User Verification with Hashing & Blockchain Concept

This project demonstrates **user identity verification** using:
- ✅ SHA-256 hashing for emails
- ✅ Differential Privacy + Neural Networks (future extension)
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook & Google Colab

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/Copy_of_Privacy_Preserving_AI_Models_with_Blockchain_Identity_Management.ipynb` → Main project notebook
- `data/` → Sample dataset (name, email, hashed_id)
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

---

## 🚀 Features
- Hashes user emails using SHA-256
- Verifies against stored `hashed_id`
- Prints ✅ Verified with **name + email** if found
- Demonstrates privacy-preserving verification
